								<span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Linux: <strong>Preliminary experimental Wayland support under GNOME 3 using colord</strong> (requires ArgyllCMS 2.1 or newer as well). Caveats do apply:
								<ul>
									<li>Window placement and ordering is completely up to the compositor under Wayland. There is generally no way for an application to place its own windows at specific relative locations or z-orders. As a result of this, the measurement window cannot stay always on top or be automatically centered. Extra care needs to be taken that other windows are not placed on top.</li>
									<li>Video card gamma table (videoLUT) access is handled by colord. Some functions like viewing current videoLUT contents may not be available.</li>
									<li>The measurement window color depth is limited to 8 bits per channel per pixel (but dithering is used to achieve a higher effective color depth).</li>
									<li>The measurement window may be subject to desktop-wide color management in upcoming versions of Wayland (although the display device is inhibited during measurements via the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/colord/gtk-doc/Device.html">org.freedesktop.ColorManager.Device</a> D-Bus API which should prevent this, and as a fallback a linear calibration sRGB profile is temporarily installed during measurements if the D-BUs API is unavailable, which should result in an identity transform, i.e. effectively no color management, as well as linear video card gamma tables).</li>
									<li>Application support for color management under Wayland via colord <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/colord/faq.html#application-support">still seems to lacking</a> (although the list may well be out-of-date).</li>
									<li>Only tested under GNOME 3 (Fedora 30, Ubuntu 19.04). Support for other desktop environments will need to be implemented separately until Wayland gains a color management and calibration/profiling protocol.</li>

						<p><strong>Phasing out 0install support.</strong> While the 0install version of ${APPNAME} (which was originally introduced as a replacement for the long-defunct Autopackage system under Linux) has had its uses, the low distribution (around 6%) of 0install versus the standalone version does no longer warrant the additional time and work needed to maintain this separate deployment path.<br />
						0install support is thus being phased out starting with ${APPNAME} 3.7.2 and following releases, which are only available as “standalone” installations. Windows and macOS users will be updated automatically to the standalone version. Linux users should switch to a standalone package at their earliest convenience.<br />
						There will be a transition period of a few months during which old 0install-based ${APPNAME} versions will continue to run, but afterwards the respective online infrastructure will be decommissioned.</p>

							<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> When generating high resolution PCS to device tables for XYZ LUT profiles, round PCS candidate “fit” so a good match is not potentially needlessly discarded in favor of a match with lower effective usage of the available lookup table grid points (may speed up the process as well).</li>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Profiling engine enhancements:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> <strong>Better multi CPU/multi core support.</strong> Generating high resolution PCS-to-device tables is now taking more advantage of multiple (physical or logical) processors (typical <strong>2x speedup</strong> on a i7 6700K CPU).</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Generating a simple high resolution perceptual table is now done by copying the colorimetric table and only generating new input curves. This markedly reduces the processing time needed to create the perceptual table (<strong>6x speedup</strong> on a i7 6700K CPU).</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Black point compensation now tries to maintain the whitepoint hue until closer to the black point. This makes curves + matrix profiles in the default configuration (slightly) more accurate as well as the default simple perceptual table of cLUT profiles provide a result that is closer to the colorimetric table.</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> The curves tags of XYZ LUT + matrix profiles will now more closely match the device-to-PCS table response (improves grayscale accuracy of the curves tags and profile generation speed slightly).</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> The curves tags of matrix profiles are further optimized for improved grayscale accuracy (possibly slightly reduced overall accuracy if a display device is not very linear).</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> XYZ LUT profiles created from small patch sets (79 and 175 patches) with regularly spaced grids (3x3x3+49 and 5x5x5+49) now have improved accuracy due to an alternate forward profiling method that works better for very sparsely sampled data. Most presets now use 5x5x5+49 grid-based patch sets by default that provide a reduction in measurement time at about the same or in some cases even slightly better accuracy than the previously used small patch sets.</li>
									<li><span class="changelog-label enhancement"><span>[</span>Enhancement<span>]</span></span> Additional PCS candidate based on the actual measured primaries of the display device for generating high resolution PCS-to-device tables. This may further reduce PCS-to-device table generation time in some cases and lead to better utilization of the available cLUT grid points.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Calibration whitepoint targets other than “As measured” will now also be used as 3D LUT whitepoint target, allowing the use of the visual whitepoint editor to set a custom whitepoint target for 3D LUTs.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Automatically offer to change the 3D LUT rendering intent to relative colorimetric when setting the calibration whitepoint to “As measured”.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Support for madVR's ability to send HDR metadata to the display via nVidia or Windows 10 APIs (i.e. switch a HDR capable display to HDR mode) when creating SMPTE 2084 3D LUTs. Note that you need to have profiled the display in HDR mode as well (currently only possible by manually enabling a display's HDR mode).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> <strong>Output levels selection as advanced option and automatic output levels detection.</strong> Note that this cannot detect if you're driving a display that expects full range (0..255) in limited range (16..235), but it can detect if you're driving a display that expects limited range in full range and will adjust the output levels accordingly.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> <strong>New experimental profiling patch sequence advanced options.</strong> “Minimize display response delay” is the ArgyllCMS default (same as in previous versions of ${APPNAME}). “Maximize lightness difference”, “Maximize luma difference”, “Maximize RGB difference” and “Vary RGB difference” are alternate choices which are aimed at potentially dealing better with displays employing ASBL (automatic static brightness limiting) leading to distorted measurements, and should be used together with display white level drift compensation.</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> Optional alternate method for creating colorimeter correction matrices that minimizes xy chromaticity difference (four color matrix method).</li>
							<li><span class="changelog-label feature"><span>[</span>Feature<span>]</span></span> The curve viewer and profile information now have the ability to plot tone response curves of RGB device link profiles.</li>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated traditional chinese translation (thanks to 楊添明).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): When creating the profile loader launcher task, set it to stop existing instance of the task when launching to circumvent a possible Windows bug where a task would not start even if no previous instance was running.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>

						<ul>
							<li>Importing colorimeter corrections from other display profiling software now only imports from the explicitly selected entries in automatic mode.</li>
							<li>Profile loader launcher (Windows): Pass through <code>--oneshot</code> argument to profile loader.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Visual whitepoint editor: Opening a second editor on the same display without first dragging the previously opened editor to another display would overwrite the cached profile association for the current display with the visual whitepoint editor temporary profile, thus preventing the correct profile association being restored when the editor was closed.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows Vista and later): The profile loader process now auto-starts with the highest available privileges if installed as administrator. This allows changing system default profile associations whenever logged in with administrative privileges.</li>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Linux, Windows: Visual whitepoint editor was not working in HiDPI mode.</li>

					<dd>
						<h3>3.2 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Visual whitepoint editor.</strong> This allows visually adjusting the whitepoint on display devices that lack hardware controls as well as match several displays to one another (or a reference). To use it, set the whitepoint to “Chromaticity” on the “Calibration” tab and click the visual whitepoint editor button (you can open as many visual whitepoint editors simultaneously as you like, so that e.g. one can be left unchanged as reference, while the other can be adjusted to match said reference). The editor window can be put into a distraction-free fullscreen mode by maximizing it (press ESC to leave fullscreen again). Adjust the whitepoint using the controls on the editor tool pane until you have achieved a visual match. Then, place your instrument on the measurement area and click “Measure”. The measured whitepoint will be set as calibration target.</li>
							<li>Another “Auto” testchart slider step with 154 patches (equal to small testchart for LUT profiles) for XYZ LUT + matrix profile type.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Menu overhaul.</strong> Menus are now better organized using categorized sub-menus and some menu items have been moved to more appropriate locations:
								<ul>
									<li>The “Options” menu no longer contains any functionality besides actual options. Advanced options have been moved to a sub-menu.</li>
									<li>Profile creation from existing measurement files or EDID, profile installation as well as profile upload (sharing) functionality can now be found in the “File” menu.</li>
									<li>Most functionality available in the “Tools” menu has been grouped into categorized sub-menus, with some of the less-used functionality now available under a separate “Advanced” sub-menu.</li>
									<li>Measuring the selected testchart, enhancing the effective resolution of a colorimetric PCS-to-device table, loading calibration and resetting the video card gamma tables, detecting displays &amp; instruments, as well as user-initiated spectrometer self-calibration functionality has been moved to the “Tools” menu and respective sub-menus where applicable.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Changed default curves + matrix profile testchart as well as first “Auto” testchart slider step back to pre-3.1.7 chart with 73 patches.</li>
							<li><strong>Better curves + matrix profiles as well as faster computation of XYZ LUT + matrix profiles.</strong> The matrix and shaper curves of gamma + matrix, curves + matrix as well as XYZ LUT + matrix profiles are now generated in separate steps which improves the shape and grayscale neutrality of the curves on less well-behaved displays. XYZ LUT + matrix profiles will compute faster, because the curves and matrix are created from a sub-set of the profiling patches, and take around the same time as XYZ LUT + swapped matrix profiles, resulting in a typical overall computation speed increase of around +33% (+100% if just looking at the time needed when not creating PCS-to-device tables) for a XYZ LUT + matrix profile computed from 1148 patches. XYZ LUT + matrix profiles computed from more patches should see a larger computation speed increase of up to +100% depending on patch count.</li>
							<li>Resolve pattern generator and non-native madVR network implementation: Determine the computer's local network IP address in a way that is hopefully more reliable across platforms.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Detect and work-around buggy Intel video drivers which, despite reverting to linear gamma tables at certain points (e.g. UAC prompts), will effectively ignore attempts to restore the gamma table calibration if it is considered to be already loaded by the driver.</li>
							<li><strong>Profile loader (Windows): Replaced “Open Windows color management settings...” pop-up menu item with own “Profile associations...” implementation.</strong> This should work better with multi-display configurations in contrast to Windows' braindead built-in counterpart, i.e. display devices will be listed under their EDID name (if available) as well as their viewport position and size on the virtual desktop and not only their often meaningless generic driver name like “PnP-Monitor”. Also, there won't be multiple entries for the same display device or ambiguous “1|2” identifications if there are display devices that are currently not part of the desktop due to being disabled in Windows display settings. Changing profile associations around is of course still using Windows color management functionality, but the custom UI will look and act more sane than what Windows color management settings has to offer.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Clicking the task bar tray icon will now always show up-to-date (at the time of clicking) information in the notification popup even if the profile loader is disabled.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Starting a new instance of the profile loader will now always attempt to close an already running instance instead of just notifying it, allowing for easy re-starting.</li>
							<li>Windows (Vista and later): Installing a profile as system default will now automatically turn off “Use my settings for this device” for the current user, so that if the system default profile is changed by another user, the change is propagated to all users that have opted to use the system default profile (which is the whole point of installing a profile as system default).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Spectrometer self-calibration using an i1 Pro or i1 Pro 2 with Argyll &gt;= 1.9 always presented the emissive dark calibration dialog irrespective of measurement mode (but still correctly did a reflective calibration if the measurement mode was one of the high resolution spectrum modes).</li>
							<li>User-initiated spectrometer self-calibration was not performed if “Allow skipping of spectrometer self-calibration” was enabled in the “Options” menu and the most recent self-calibration was still fresh.</li>
							<li>Cosmetic: If an update check, colorimeter correction query or profile sharing upload returned a HTTP status code equal to or greater than 400 (server-side error), an unhandled exception was raised instead of presenting a nicer, formatted error dialog (regression of ${APPNAME} 3.1.7 instrument driver installer download related changes).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows, cosmetic): Reflect changed display resolution and position in UI (doesn't influence functionality).</li>
							<li>Resolve pattern generator: Unhandled exception if the system hostname could not be resolved to an IP address.</li>

						<h3>3.1.7.2 </h3>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Windows: Toggling the “Load calibration on login” checkbox in the profile installation dialog now also toggles preserving calibration state in the profile loader and vice versa, thus actually affecting if calibration is loaded on login or not (this restores functionality that was lost with the initial DisplayCAL 3.1 release).</li>
							<li>Windows: The application, setup and Argyll USB driver installer executables are now digitally signed (starting from October 18, 2016 with SHA-1 digest for 3.1.7.1 and dual SHA-1 and SHA-256 digests for 3.1.7.2 from October 21, 2016).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>3D LUT sizes 5x5x5 and 9x9x9.</li>
							<li>JETI spectraval 1511/1501 support (requires ArgyllCMS &gt;= 1.9).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): User-definable exceptions.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Added <code>reset-vcgt</code> scripting command (equivalent to selecting “Reset video card gamma table” from the popup menu).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>“Auto” resolution of PCS-to-device tables is now limited to 45x45x45 to prevent excessive processing times with profiles from “funky” measurements (i.e. due to bad/inaccurate instrument).</li>
							<li>Automatically optimized testcharts now use curves + matrix profiles for preconditioning to prevent a possible hang while creating the preconditioned testchart with LUT-type profiles from sufficiently “badly behaved” displays.</li>
							<li>2nd auto-optimized testchart slider step now defaults to XYZ LUT profile type as well, and the previous patch count was increased from 97 to 271 (necessary for baseline LUT profile accuracy).</li>
							<li>Adjusted curves + matrix testcharts to only include fully saturated RGB and grayscale to prevent tinted neutrals and/or “rollercoaster” curves on not-so-well behaved displays (also reduces testchart patch count and measurement time, but may worsen the resulting profile's overall accuracy).</li>
							<li>Removed near-black and near-white 1% grayscale increments from “video” verification charts.</li>
							<li>Use a 20 second timeout for unresponsive downloads.</li>
							<li>Windows: <strong>Much easier ArgyllCMS instrument driver installation</strong> (for instruments that require it). No need to disable driver signature enforcement under Windows 8/10 anymore. Select “Install ArgyllCMS instrument drivers...” from the “Tools” menu, click “Download &amp; install”, wait briefly for the download to finish (400 KB), confirm the User Access Control popup, done. Note that the driver installer executable is currently not digitally signed (obtaining a suitable certificate from a trusted authority is in progress), but the driver itself is signed as usual. The installer is based on <a href="https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi">libwdi</a>.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Changed <code>apply-profiles</code> scripting command to behave excatly like selecting “Load calibration from current display device profile(s)” from the popup menu, i.e. not only load calibration, but also change the setting.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Also count calibration state being (re)applied when the profile loader state or profile association(s) changes.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Update measurement modes after importing colorimeter corrections. Fixes additional measurement modes for the Spyder4/5 not appearing until the program is restarted or a different instrument is selected first.</li>
							<li>Trivial: Instrument setup was unnecessarily being called twice after downloading ArgyllCMS when the latter wasn't previously detected.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: Work around a wxPython bug which prevents launching the application from a path containing non-ASCII characters.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: Work around a configuration problem affecting ArgyllCMS 1.9 and 1.9.1 (fixes Spyder2 firmware, additional Spyder4/5 measurement modes, and imported colorimeter corrections not being seen by DisplayCAL if imported via ArgyllCMS 1.9 or 1.9.1).</li>

						<h3>3.1.6 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR/SMPTE 2084: Advanced options to specify maximum content light level for roll-off (use with care!) as well as content colorspace (affects perceptual intent gamut mapping, less so colorimetric).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Increased timeout to launch ArgyllCMS tools to 20 seconds.</li>
							<li>Show failed items when otherwise successfully importing colorimeter corrections, and detect updated CCSS files.</li>
							<li>HDR/SMPTE 2084: Improve overall saturation preservation.</li>
							<li>Linux/colord: When checking for a valid colord device ID, also try with manufacturer omitted.</li>
							<li>Windows Vista and later: Use “known folders” API to determine path to “Downloads” directory.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR/SMPTE 2084: Slightly too light near-black tones when black output offset was set to below 100%.</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC Profile Creator: Undefined variable when creating synthetic profile with custom gamma or BT.1886 and non-zero black level (regression of HDR-related changes made in 3.1.5).</li>
							<li>When loading settings from a profile created with ${APPNAME} prior to 3.1.5 and custom 3D LUT tone curve gamma in ${APPNAME} 3.1.5, the gamma and output offset controls wouldn't be shown if advanced options weren't enabled until re-selecting the tone curve choice.</li>
							<li>Cosmetic (Windows 10): Banner would go blank under some Windows 10 configurations when showing the profile or 3D LUT installation dialog.</li>
							<li>Cosmetic (Linux): Missing backgrounds and wrongly sized combo boxes when wxGTK is built against GTK3.</li>
							<li>Linux: Profile loader autostart entry was installed under wrong (mixed-case) name if installing for the current user, which lead to the loader unnecesarily being run twice if ${APPNAME} was installed from a RPM or DEB package. The superfluous loader entry will be automatically removed the next time you install a profile, or you can remove it manually by running <code>rm ~/.config/autostart/z-DisplayCAL-apply-profiles.desktop</code> in a terminal.</li>
							<li>Linux/colord: Don't cache device IDs that are not the result of a successful query.</li>
							<li>Windows: Make elevated subprocess calls synchronous. Fixes importing colorimeter corrections system-wide not listing all succesfully imported items on the first use.</li>

						<h3>3.1.4 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A fourth Rec. 709 encompassing color space variant as a profile connection space candidate for XYZ LUT profiles. May lead to better utilization of PCS-to-device color lookup table grid points in some cases (and thus potentially smaller profiles when the effective resolution is set to the default of “Auto”).</li>
							<li>An option to include legacy serial ports (if any) in detected instruments.</li>
							<li>SMPTE 2084 (HDR) as 3D LUT tone curve choice.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't preserve shaper curves in ICC device link profiles if selected as 3D LUT output format (effectively matching other 3D LUT formats).</li>
							<li>Removed “Prepress” preset due to large overlap with “Softproof”.</li>
							<li>Changed “Softproof” preset to use 5800K whitepoint target (in line with Fogra softproof handbook typical photography workflow suggested starting point value) and automatic black point hue correction.</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC profile creator: Changed SMPTE 2084 to always clip (optionally with roll-off) if peak white is below 10000 cd/m².</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC profile creator: Changed transition to specified black point of generated profiles to be consistent with BT.1886 black point blending (less gradual transition, blend over to specified black point considerably closer to black).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): If no profile assigned, load implicit linear calibration.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When loading settings from an existing profile, some CIECAM02 advanced profiling options were not recognized correctly.</li>
							<li>Don't accidentally remove the current display profile if ArgyllCMS is older than version 1.1 or the ArgyllCMS version is not included in the first line of output due to interference with QuickKeys under Mac OS X.</li>
							<li>Make sure the ArgyllCMS version is detected even if it isn't contained in the first line of output (fixes ArgyllCMS version not being detected if QuickKeys Input Manager is installed under Mac OS X).</li>
							<li>When loading settings, add 3D LUT input profile to selector if not yet present.</li>
							<li>Curve viewer/profile information: Fix potential division by zero error when graphing unusual curves (e.g. non-monotonic or with very harsh bends).</li>
							<li>Profile information: Reset right pane row background color on each profile load (fixes “named color” profile color swatches sticking even after loading a different profile).</li>

						<h3>3.1.3 </h3>

						<p><strong>If you update from ${APPNAME} 3.1/3.1.1/3.1.2 standalone under Windows using the installer</strong>, please close the profile loader manually (if it is running) before running setup - due to an unfortunate bug, the installer may not be able to close and restart the profile loader automatically, which may then require using the task manager to end the profile loader process. Apologies for the inconvenience.</p>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Device link profile as possible 3D LUT output format.</li>
							<li>French ReadMe (thanks to Jean-Luc Coulon).</li>
							<li>Partial traditional chinese localization (work-in-progress, thanks to 楊添明).</li>
							<li>When you change the language in ${APPNAME}, the Windows Profile Loader will follow on-the-fly if running.</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC profile creator: Capability to specify profile class, technology and colorimetric image state.</li>
							<li>Windows: When the display configuration is changed while ${APPNAME} is running, automatically re-enumerate displays, and load calibration if using the profile loader.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Starting the loader with the <code>--oneshot</code> argument will make it exit after launching.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated ReShade 3D LUT installation instructions in the ReadMe.</li>
							<li>Improved “Enhance effective resolution of PCS to device tables” smoothing accuracy slightly.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows):
								<ul>
									<li>Detect CPKeeper (Color Profile Keeper) and HCFR.</li>
									<li>Show any calibration loading errors on startup or display/profile change in a notification popup, and also reflect this with a different icon.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Added semicolon (“;”) to disallowed profile name characters.</li>
							<li>ICC profile objects were leaking memory.</li>
							<li>Windows: Made sure that the virtual console size is not larger than the maximum allowed size (fixes possible inability to launch ArgyllCMS tools on some systems if the Windows scaling factor was equal to or above 175%).</li>
							<li>Windows (Vista and newer): Use system-wide profiles if per-user profiles are disabled.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows):
								<ul>
									<li>If Windows calibration management is enabled (not recommended!), correctly reflect the disabled state of the profile loader in the task tray icon and don't load calibration when launching the profile loader (but keep track of profile assignment changes).</li>
									<li>Prevent a race condition when “Fix profile associations automatically” is enabled and changing the display configuration, which could lead to wrong profile associations not being fixed.</li>
									<li>Sometimes the loader did not exit cleanly if using <code>taskkill</code> or similar external methods.</li>
									<li>Prevent a race condition where the loader could try to access a no longer available display device right after a display configuration change, which resulted in no longer being able to influence the calibration state (requiring a loader restart to fix).</li>
									<li>Profile loader not reacting to display changes under Windows XP.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

						<h3>3.1 </h3>

						<h4>dispcalGUI has been renamed to ${APPNAME}.</h4>

						<p><strong>If you upgrade using 0install under Linux:</strong> It is recommended that you download the respective <a href="${URL}#download">${APPNAME}-0install package</a> for your distribution and install it so that the applications accessible via the menu of your desktop environment are updated properly.</p>

						<p><strong>If you upgrade using 0install under Mac OS X:</strong> It is recommended that you delete existing dispcalGUI application icons, then download the <a rel="nofollow" href="${URL}download/${APPNAME}-0install.dmg">${APPNAME}-0install.dmg</a> disk image to get updated applications.</p>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Better HiDPI support.</strong> All text should now be crisp on HiDPI displays (with the exception of axis labels on curve and gamut graphs under Mac OS X). Icons will be scaled according to the scaling factor or DPI set in the display settings under Windows, or the respective (font) scaling or DPI system setting under Linux. Icons will be scaled down or up from their 2x version if a matching size is not available. Note that support for crisp icons in HiDPI mode is currently not available in the GTK3 and Mac OS X port of wxPython/wxWidgets. Also note that if you run a multi-monitor configuration, the application is system-DPI aware but not per-monitor-DPI aware, which is a limitation of wxPython/wxWidgets (under Windows, you will need to log out and back in after changing DPI settings for changes to take effect in ${APPNAME}).</li>
							<li>When having created a compressed archive of a profile and related files, it can now also be imported back in via drag'n'drop or the “Load settings...” menu entry and respective button.</li>
							<li>ArgyllCMS can be automatically downloaded and updated.</li>
							<li>A compressed logs archive can be created from the log window.</li>
							<li><strong>Windows: New profile loader.</strong> It will stay in the taskbar tray and automatically reload calibration if the display configuration changes or if the calibration is lost (although fullscreen Direct3D applications can still override the calibration). It can also automatically fix profile associations when switching from a multi-monitor configuration to a single display and vice versa (only under Vista and later). In addition, the profile loader is <a href="http://madvr.com/">madVR</a>-aware and will disable calibration loading if it detects e.g. madTPG or madVR being used by a video player.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Changed default calibration speed from “Medium” to “Fast”. Typically this cuts calibration time in half, while the accuracy difference is negligible at below 0.2 delta E.</li>
							<li>Enabled “Enhance effective resolution of PCS to device tables” and smoothing for L*a*b* LUT profiles.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>In some cases, importing colorimeter corrections from the vendor software CD could fail (falling back to downloading them from the web).</li>
							<li>Moving the auto testchart patches slider to a value that changed the profile type did not update BPC accordingly (shaper+matrix defaults to BPC on).</li>
							<li>Minor: Safari/IE messed up positioning of CCT graph vertical axis labels in measurement reports.</li>
							<li>Minor: When clicking the “Install profile” button while not on the 3D LUT tab, and “Create 3D LUT after profiling” is enabled, don't create a 3D LUT.</li>
							<li>Minor: When changing profile type, only change the selected testchart if needed, and default to “Auto” for all profile types.</li>
							<li>Minor: 1st launch defaults were slightly different from what was intended (testchart should be “Auto”).</li>
							<li>Minor: Use OS line separator when writing configuration files.</li>
							<li>Linux: Text and icon sizes should be more consistent accross the application when the system text scaling or DPI has been adjusted (application restart required).</li>
							<li>Linux: Fall back to use the XrandR display name for colord device IDs if EDID is not available.</li>
							<li>Linux/Mac OS X: madVR test pattern generator interface was prone to connection failures due to a race condition. Also, verifying a madVR 3D LUT didn't work.</li>
