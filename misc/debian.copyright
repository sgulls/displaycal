 --------------------------------
 2.1. Grants
 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
 non-exclusive license:
 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
     as part of a Larger Work; and
 (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
     Contributions or its Contributor Version.
 2.2. Effective Date
 The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
 distributes such Contribution.
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
     or
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
     Version); or
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
     its Contributions.
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
 2.5. Representation
 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 2.6. Fair Use
 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
 2.7. Conditions
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 in Section 2.1.
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 3.4. Notices
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 5. Termination
 --------------
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.

 *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
 *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
 *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
 *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
 *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
 *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
 *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
 *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
 *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
 *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *

 *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *

 *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *

 *                                                                      *
 ************************************************************************
 8. Litigation
 -------------
 Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
 courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
 place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
 jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
 Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
 cross-claims or counter-claims.
 9. Miscellaneous
 ----------------
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
 necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
 that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
 shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
 10. Versions of the License
 ---------------------------
 10.1. New Versions
 Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
 publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
 distinguishing version number.

 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
 OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
 RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
 AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
     other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
     derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
     literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
     cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
     be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
     recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
     constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
     Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
     synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
     ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
     this License.
  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
     as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
     broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
     listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations,
     in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form
     along with one or more other contributions, each constituting
     separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below)
     for the purposes of this License.
  c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is
     listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has
     been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent
     to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i)
     contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as
     the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits
     the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that
     license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction
     license with the same License Elements as this License.
  d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
     copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
     other transfer of ownership.

     that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
     work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
     the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the
     publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the
     actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,
     sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
     literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
     case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
     who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits
     the broadcast.
  h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
     terms of this License including without limitation any production

     the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as
     a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
     other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
     work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
     composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
     are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
     cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
     sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
     are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
     photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,

     copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
     performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
     or artistic work.
  i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
  j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
     and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
     means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
     digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
     a way that members of the public may access these Works from a
     place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the

     of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
     electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
     Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
     incorporated in Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
       i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
          jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
          any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
          the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
          royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
          this License;
      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
          which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
          compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
          the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
          by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
          collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
          the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
          administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
          from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
          License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
     terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
     Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
     Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
     impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
     License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
     rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
     You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
     that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
     every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
     effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
     ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
     granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
     Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection,
     but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself
     to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
     Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
     practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by
     Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
     notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c),
     as requested.
  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
     terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
     with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
     Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
     version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
     (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
     Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
     licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
     license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
     the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
     License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
     generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy
     of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each
     Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not
     offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms
     of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the
     Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
     the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all
     notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer
     of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
     Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose
     any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
     exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
     the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation
     as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
     Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
     the terms of the Applicable License.
  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
     or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant
     to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
     the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
     supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
     another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
     entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
     Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
     reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
     of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
     practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
     copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
     consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
     credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
     this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection,
     at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
     contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then
     as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as
     the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance
     of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for
     the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
     exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
     or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
     endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
     Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
     the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
     Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
  d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
     or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
     be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
     Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
     any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
     (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
     mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
     the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
     or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
     permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
     (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
 YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
     Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
     their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
     remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
     7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
     terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
     force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
     Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
     Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
     the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
     this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
     understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
     Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
     additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
     You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
     agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
     this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
     Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
     amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
     WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
     Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
     on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in
     the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
     be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable
     national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
     applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted
     under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
     included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict
     the license of any rights under applicable law.
